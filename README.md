# StockFlow - Real-Time Stock Signal Analysis Microservice

StockFlow is an automated stock analysis platform developed to enhance the efficiency of identifying potential trading opportunities. Designed to replicate and automate the analytical methods and indicators I typically employ, StockFlow systematically evaluates a broad range of stocks and generates a curated shortlist of candidates warranting further review.

## Why was it built ?
This tool is intended to serve as an initial screening layer for me, providing structured assistance in narrowing down the universe of stocks to those with promising characteristics. It is not a definitive prediction system to be relied upon blindly but rather a time-saving aid that supports more focused and informed decision-making. By automating the preliminary stages of analysis, StockFlow significantly reduces the effort and time required by me to identify high-potential stocks for further evaluation.

## Who is it for ?
Anyone who wants to trim down potential stocks to a limited count so that they can invest less time in initial screening and focus on more deeper analysis.
